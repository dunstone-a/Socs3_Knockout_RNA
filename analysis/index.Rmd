**Aim**: Investigate the differences in gene expression between wild-type samples and Socs3 knockout samples. 

**Samples**:

We have 6 mice samples, 3 are wild-type and 3 are Socs3 knockout samples. 

- WT: Wild-type.
- SOCS3: Socs3 gene knockout. 

Each sample was sequenced across 8 lanes. 

**Batches**:

There are 2 batches. 

- Batch1: 2 WT samples, 2 SOCS3 samples. 
- Batch2: 1 WT sample, 1 SOCS3 sample.
